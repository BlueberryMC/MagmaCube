# MagmaCube

## What's this

A Minecraft that you can patch your own patches into the Minecraft.

Based on 1.18 Pre-release 3 currently.

## Goal
- Make it editable easily by everyone who wants to code Minecraft

## Note
- **You cannot distribute the source code generated by this project.** <small>(see [Minecraft EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) for details)</small>
- Do not redistribute the jar file, without any exception. It is against the Mojang's ToS.

## Things I noticed
- Modify player name tag with `PlayerRenderer#renderNameTag`
- enable debug renderers at DebugRenderer
- PlayerTabOverlay to modify how tab renders on multiplayer

Properties can be set via jvm argument `-Dkey=value`.
