# MagmaCube

## What's this

A Minecraft that you can patch your own patches into the Minecraft.

Based on MC 1.16.3 currently.

## Current goal
- Make it work, without bugs.
- Understand the code

## Goal
- Make it editable easily by everyone who wants to code Minecraft
- Complete compatibility with vanilla

## Note
- You should not use this project for any bad usages
- Do not redistribute the jar file, without any exception. It is against the Mojang's ToS.

## Bugs
- Spectator mode is broken, can't pass through blocks
- World Generation is trash
- Translation in TranslatableComponent is missing?
- Not loading some textures
- Block break animation does not play (block breaks will be saved to the world, though)

## Todo
- Fix GuiComponent#fill

## Things I noticed
- I think we can comment out (or modify the condition on Line 453) Line 454 on `net.minecraft.client.renderer.GameRenderer` to completely disable nausea effect
- We can write Line 258 at `net.minecraft.client.gui.screens.TitleScreen` to display custom title text
